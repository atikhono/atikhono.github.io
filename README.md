# My tiny Jekyll-based blog

Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

I use the (mostly) standard Jekyll theme because:
* It's small yet it has all I need and easy to make little changes,
* It has a clean look,
* It looks good on various screen configurations.
